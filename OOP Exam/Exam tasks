"Object-oriented programming"
Control work for students of the 2nd year of the Faculty of Informatics of the National University "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"
Spring trimester 2023-24 academic year

Task 1: ﻿﻿﻿Without using loops and branches using patterns of partial specializations, write a program to output the first 10 powers of two.
Task 2: Define a parameterized class of abstract doubly linked lists
¡Double listing.
Task 3: ﻿﻿﻿Implement the parameterized DoubleList class of doubly linked lists.
Task 4: ﻿﻿﻿Implement a parameterized class of cyclic doubly linked lists
CyclicDoubleList.
Task 5: After supplementing doubly linked lists with iterators, implement a search function for a given element in the list. Apply these to each of the list types.
Task 6: ﻿﻿﻿Define the Pyramide class of triangular pyramids by four vertices, providing vertex selectors and modifiers.
Task 7: Complete the pyramid with the functions of building its faces.
﻿﻿﻿Task 8:Define the class of short strings template <int n> class ShortString of length not greater than n.
Task 9: ﻿﻿﻿In the ShortString class, implement the += and + concatenation operators. 
Taskn 10: When going beyond n, create an exceptional situation.
﻿﻿﻿﻿Program the processing
• exceptional
situations
in the ShortString class
calculating the result of an interrupted operation
in the String class of lines
unlimited pool.
